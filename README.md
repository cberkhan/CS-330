How do I approach designing software? What new design skills has your work on the project helped you to craft? What design process did you follow for your project work?
How could tactics from your design approach be applied in future work?

OpenGL was completely new to me when I began this project. I have learned how to utilize OpenGL to render objects, recreate 3D scenes, texture objects, create camera controls, and apply lighting to a scene. I really enjoy breaking down a project into smaller steps to complete each task in increments. I would create a single shape at a time and position it where it needed to be based on my original scene. I would then build upon that shape, if other shapes were needed to complete the object, and finally texture the object. This approach allowed me to complete sections of my scene at a time and to resolve any issues. After the completion of my first object, I added the controls for the camera to enable viewing the scene completely. 


How do I approach developing programs? What new development strategies did you use while working on your 3D scene? How did iteration factor into your development?
How has your approach to developing code evolved throughout the milestones, which led you to the project’s completion?

I typically approach developing programs by first reviewing the requirements thoroughly to ensure I will fully meet them and understand the purpose/function of the software. At the beginning of this project, I did not fully understand the required number of shapes and had to adjust my scene late in the development process. Iteration was a major factor in the development of my program. It was a constant cycle of creating the shape, positioning the shape, and then texturing the shape. In my opinion, it made the development process go smoothly because I always knew what was next after the completion of one step. My approach to developing code has become more modular. While I did utilize the “URender” function to create and texture my shapes, it made it simple to bind and unbind arrays to complete and end the creation of a shape. 

How can computer science help me in reaching my goals? How do computational graphics and visualizations give you new knowledge and skills that can be applied in your future educational pathway? How do computational graphics and visualizations give you new knowledge and skills that can be applied in your future professional pathway?

Computational graphics and visualizations expanded my skillset greatly.  I have learned a great deal about developing code, planning, and using OpenGL. I am not sure if in the future I will follow a career utilizing computational graphics; however, I am sure the knowledge I have gained during this course will at some point help me in my career.
